## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This web app was developed as part of the BSale hiring process. The main objective is to the determine if I have the knowledge/skills to consume an API REST and display the data in a user friendly manner.

The app can display products, products by category, has search and sorting functionality. It is also responsive.

## Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites"></a>

First of all you'll need to have up and running the backend that is consumed by this web app. You can find the backend <a href="https://github.com/alvmoralesm/bsale-backend">here</a> with its documentation that'll help you set it up properly. After you've done, you can continue with this. You'll also need to have installed <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> in your local machine.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Built Using <a name = "built_using"></a>

- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Server Framework
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Server Environment

## Why did I use this technologies? <a name = "why_this"></a>

<p style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 2.2vh"><b>Bootstrap:</b> One of the reasons for the use of Bootstrap is its mobile first design approach, making it so much expeditious to make a responsive web app. Another reason would be the great list of components provided by Bootstrap. Finally, the main reason is because is my main CSS framework. Is the one that I'm more capable with. </p>

<p style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 2.2vh"><b>Node.js:</b> I used Node.js because is my main technology for building backends. I feel more comfortable using Node.js than any other server environment/framework. This is also because I completed a Web Development Bootcamp that used Node.js to build the backend.</p>

<p style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 2.2vh"><b>Express.js:</b> You can build a backends only using Node.js but using it in conjunction with Express.js simplifies the job and makes the code easier to read. It is also easy to learn and reliable. As mentioned before this is also because I completed a Web Development Bootcamp that used Node.js with Express.js to build the backend.</p>

<p style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 2.2vh">The last and main reason to consider is that Javascript is the language that I'm more proficient with.</p>
